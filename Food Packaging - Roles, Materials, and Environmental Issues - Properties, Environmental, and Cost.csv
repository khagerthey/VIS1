Material,Product Characteristics/Food Compatibility,,Consumer/Marketing Issues,,Environmental Issues,,Cost
,Advantages,Disadvantages,Advantages,Disadvantages,Advantages,Disadvantages,
Glass,Impermeable to moisture and gases,Brittle and breakable,"Transparent, allows consumer to see product",Poor portability: heavy and breakable,Reusable,Heavy and bulky to transport,Low cost material but somewhat costly to transport
,Nonreactive (inert),Needs a separate closure,Can be colored for light-sensitive products,Relatively difficult to decorate,Recyclable,,
,Withstands heat processing,,,,Often contains recycled content,,
Aluminum,Impermeable to moisture and gases,Cannot be welded,Easy to decorate,Limited shapes,Recyclable,No disadvantages in rigid form,Relatively expensive but value encourages recycling
,Resistant to corrosion,Limited structural strength,Lightweight,,Lightweight,Separation difficulties in laminated form,
,Withstands heat processing,,"Good portability, lightweight, and not breakable",,Economic incentive to recycle,,
Tinplate,Impermeable,Can react with foods; coating required,Easy to decorate,Typically requires a can opener to access product,Recyclable,Heavier than aluminum,Cheaper than aluminum
,Strong and formable,,,,Magnetic thus easily separated,,
,Resistant to corrosion,,,,,,
,Withstands heat processing,,,,,,
Tin-Free Steel,Strong,"Difficult to weld, requires removal of coating",Easy to decorate,Typically requires a can opener to access product,Recyclable,Heavier than aluminum,Cheaper than tinplate
,Good resistance to corrosion,Less resistant to corrosion,,,Magnetic thus easily separated,,
,Withstands heat processing,,,,,,
Polyolefins,Good moisture barrier,Poor gas barrier,Lightweight,Slight haze or translucency,Recyclable,Easily recycled in semi-rigid form but identification and separation more difficult for films,Low cost
,Strong,,,,High energy source for incineration,,
,Resistant to chemicals,,,,,,
Polyesters,Strong,,High clarity,,Recyclable,Easily recycled in semi-rigid form but identification and separation more difficult for films,Inexpensive but higher cost among plastics
,Withstands hot filling,,Shatter resistant,,,,
,Good barrier properties,,,,,,
Polyvinyl Chloride,Moldable,,High clarity,,Recyclable,Contains chlorine,Inexpensive
,Resistant to chemicals,,,,,Requires separating from other waste,
Polyvinylidene Chloride,High barrier to moisture and gases,,Maintains product quality,,Recyclable,Contains chlorine,Inexpensive but higher cost among plastics
,Heat sealable,,,,,Requires separating from other waste,
,Withstands hot filling,,,,,,
Polystyrene,"Available in rigid, film, and foam form",Poor barrier properties,Good clarity,,Recyclable,Requires separating from other waste,Inexpensive
Polyamide,Strong,,,,Recyclable,Requires separating from other waste,Inexpensive but higher cost among plastics
,Good barrier properties,,,,,,
Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol,High barrier to gases and oils/fat,Low moisture barrier/ moisture sensitive,Maintains product quality for oxygen-sensitive products,,Recyclable,Requires separating from other waste,Inexpensive when used as thin film
PLA,Biodegradable hydrolysable,,,,Recyclable,Requires separating from other waste,Relatively expensive
Paper and Paperboard,Very good strength to weight characteristics,Poor barrier to light,Low-density materials,"Moisture sensitive, loses strength with increasing humidity",Made from renewable resources,,Low cost
,,Recycled content makes it unsuitable for food contact material,Easily decorated,Tears easily,,,
Laminates/ Co-extrusions,Properties can be tailored for product needs,,Flexibility in design and characteristics,,Often allows for source reduction,Layer separation is required,Relatively expensive but cost effective for purpose
