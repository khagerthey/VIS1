I believe that it is likely that the glass breakages are building up to be our most cost driven issue. From what I have seen it is only growing and I believe that it is due to thermal shock resulting from the way Chelten House handles and stores their glass. \n",

I will also resource daily downtime reports from operations and the warehouseâ€™s glass count sheets. The downtime reports will allow me to analyze how much time is lost due to glass breakages and QA process in total compared to other issues. The glass count sheets will show me how much glass we lose in storage and/or if it is being shipped to us already damaged.\n"
